Bootstrap Theme


# Create a Theme: "Simply Me"

This page will show you how to build a Bootstrap theme from scratch.

We will start with a simple HTML page, and then add more and more components, until we have a fully functional, personal and responsive website.

The result will look like this, and you are free to modify, save, share, use or do whatever you want with it
